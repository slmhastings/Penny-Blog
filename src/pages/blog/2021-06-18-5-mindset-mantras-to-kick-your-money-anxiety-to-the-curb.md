# Your first step to kick that money anxiety to the curb? Notice your money self-talk.

Women, men, everyone – we all have stories we tell ourselves about money. 

And, as women on a mission to empower all women with [financial know-how and smart money moves](https://www.penny-finance.com/), we’ve heard it all. 

* I'm not good with money
* Learning about finance and investing is too hard, too complicated
* I’m in debt – but I just need to work harder to pay off my bills
* I don’t have time to learn about investing or smart money moves
* I need to know about finance to manage money well

How do we know? 

Because… WE THINK THESE THOUGHTS TOO! 

Sounds crazy, but it’s true.

# We all tell ourselves stories about money, life, and why we can or can’t do something… BUT ARE THEY TRUE?

When you start to notice these stories, also start to question where they’re coming from.

Really, QUESTION EVERYTHING! 

Doing that helps you uncover what’s underneath these stories – including the deep-seated beliefs you have about money that are holding you back.

Let’s take the first bullet point from earlier as an example:

“I’m not good with money”

When you notice this thought, ask: 

* **Why do I think I’m not good with money?** 
* **Why am I telling myself this story?** 
* **Do I really think that? Or am I just afraid of something else?** 

…And keep digging! 

You might find the only reason you believe this is because somewhere along the way, someone told you “Women aren’t good with money”.

And your younger self went… Oh! Women aren’t good with money. I guess that’s true, so that explains why I’m not good with money. 

(Which is complete BS and you know it!)

If you need a reminder about why women are awesome investors, planners, and money-makers, [we wrote this post for you](https://blog.penny-finance.com/blog/2021-03-30-women-are-freakin%E2%80%99-awesome-your-financial-mentor-should-be-too/).

PS. This work can get real heavy, real quick. Give yourself time to rest, and dive into the self-care. Chat with a therapist or close friend you feel safe with. Go easy on yourself, girl!
