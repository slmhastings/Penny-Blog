The financial industry isn’t hard, it was set up to be hard. And one thing that is unnecessarily hard are the names of financial things.

Sometimes it feels like a group of kids woke up one day and said, you know what we should do? We should create code names for all of these cool investments that can help you save more money, so nobody else can play this game with us. Well, no more of that.

We’re here to ensure you can get in on this money-saving game, too.

# What are these things?

#### 401ks, IRAs and the like are retirement accounts that have tax benefits.

They are named after the tax codes that brought them about, which is why they sound like an alien language. You will never need to know why they are called what they are called, but you do need to know why they might be good for you.

They are accounts that have major tax savings, and are designed to help you save for your future. 

Who wants to work forever? Ok, maybe you love your job. We hope you love your job. But regardless, you at least want the choice to stop working at some point, right? These retirement accounts, 401ks and IRAs, help you save, grow and invest so you don’t have to worry about money down the road.

# Why should I have a 401k or IRA? Why now?

#### Major tax savings. Free money. Did someone say free?

Think of these accounts as an extension of savings accounts offered by your bank or financial institution. They make it easier for you to save and grow your money, right?

A 401k and IRA work in the same way, with extra perks.

* You either pay less taxes today (more money in your pocket) or pay less taxes later (again, more money in your pocket)
* You can buy and sell investments within the account tax-free (more money in your pocket)
* Your company may match the amount you contribute to the account (you know it, more money in your pocket)

Most people dismiss retirement accounts, thinking you can wait to start until you’re older and wiser. Here’s the thing: The earlier you start, the more you can make. You can make more money by putting away a small amount today – than if you wait for that bigger paycheck when you’re 40. Seems counter-intuitive, but it’s how the math works. 

No, seriously. Let’s talk numbers for a second. If you start to invest $3K per year when you’re 22, you could have $750K at 65. 

**SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND!**

Yes, you read that right. And thats with $300 a month for a year. Magic!

P.S. Access to this calendar is available in [our handy app](www.penny-finance.com). 

When you set up one (or more) of these retirement accounts, it means you can keep even more of your money for future you to enjoy. Win, win, win.

* You pay less taxes, so you save money twice: (1) You’re storing your money for future use, and (2) you’re paying less taxes on the amount you’re saving and investing.
* You have the same opportunity to invest your money as with any traditional bank account (again, tax-free). Saving for your future doesn’t mean your money has to sit there, rotting away with virtual cobwebs and zero growth. You can invest your savings, and watch your retirement funds double, triple, and quadruple. 
* You can save double the amount if your employer matches your contribution. These accounts offer major tax savings for companies too, so many are open to this. The amount they match is separate from your actual salary, so you really do get extra free money just for saving money.
* You don’t have to wait until you’re making thousands of dollars, graduate, or the stars align. You can open an account today and start saving and investing even if you don’t have a lot of income to spare. More money in your pocket. Even if you don’t have a lot of it to start with.

Are your eyes glazing over? We know... its impossible to teach via a blog. That's why we built Penny. Our app shows you how, instead. Because, how can you actually apply this info to your ever-changing life?
