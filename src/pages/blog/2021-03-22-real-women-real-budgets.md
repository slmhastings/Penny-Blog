We \*love\* real-life financial advice. It’s always – Save 20% of your income, Never spend over 30% on rent, Keep 5% for retirement… How the heck do you action that? Yeah, not happening. 

Full disclosure: We don’t love “budgeting” in the traditional sense. Budgeting implies you have to cut things out. And who wants to do that? Nobody. (us included)

We think of budgeting differently. Our mini budget method helps you think big picture. It’s a learning exercise that promotes mindful spending (and stops letting the small stuff weigh you down).

[Check out our mini-budget method ](<mini budget blog posts>)

Basically, budgeting = knowing your numbers. 

When you know what you are working with, you can make better decisions that suit your lifestyle – like deciding if you have to fund a negative balance – with your own money rules. Not random percentages with one-size-fits-all solutions. 

We promised we’d show you how. 

Here are 3 anonymous women’s budgets, with notes, to give you more perspective on the mini budget method, and how to tweak it to make it all work for you.

# **Money Maker 1 - Hometown Gal**

This money maker is a home-owner, car-owner, living in the burbs, and working in the healthcare industry (ty for your service!)

> **$52,000 salary** >> wow! 
>
> **$11,000 taxes** >> yup, don’t forget about this – [read your pay stub](<read your pay stub post>) to get where it goes
>
> **$38,000 expenses** >> when you add it up, kinda makes you feel sick huh?

$52,000 - $11,000 - $38,000 = **$3k left to play** 

\
Ok what makes up the $38k in expenses? 

\
Mortgage*

$1,182

Wahoo, homeowner, you go! – we fully support your new home as long as you can comfortably pay this every month and don’t mind parting with the down payment (which you do with $3k left over at the end of the year!)

\---

Electric*

$ 40 

gotta live 

\---

Home insurance*

$129

you never know, gotta do it 

\---

Property taxes*

$400

remember to factor this in before you buy that house!

\---

Car payment*

$250

some of us need wheels

\---

Car insurance* 

$150

gotta have protection ;) – super saver tip, the higher your credit score, the lower your car insurance 

\---

Wifi/tv

$ 41 

gotta connect – this is actually really low – with cable and all the streaming services, you could pay close to $200 in here 

\---

Spotify

$ 6 

music fuels the soul – I see a lot of women want to cut things like Spotify out, but in the grand scheme of things, this doesn’t break the bank (but your mortgage might, which is why you gotta think twice before you buy!)

\---

Groceries*

$ 320 

gotta eat

\---

Going out for food + fun

$ 350 

great! – pick a number and stick to it. 

\---

Clothing

$ 120 

again, pick a number and stick to it – it really helps to set a goal, but make sure it is realistic. Some of our Penny gals would be fine, I would surpass $120 every month for sure lol

\---

Eyebrows

$ 50 

whatever makes you feel good, seriously, as long as you are mindful!

\---

Personal care

$ 45 

this is very low – think haircuts, manicures, etc. – who can get a haircut for less than $100 these days? 

\---

Misc.

$ 75 

yup. life. random things come up. 

OK what does this all add up to? 

> **$3,158** per month total 
>
> (aka $38K annually)
>
> **$2,471** per month are \*must-pay\* items -- we put a * next to those
>
> (that means we want your emergency savings to be about **$14k** before makin any other money moves)

P.S. We've built these calcs into our app, if you wanna [get your personal numbers](www.penny-finance.com/quiz)

We are SO proud of this gal! She’s making bank AND being extra-mindful of expenses.



Surprised we didn’t tell her to cut out Spotify, shopping, or personal care? Girl, you’re here to enjoy life, not hate it. 



This is what we mean by mindful spending vs traditional budgeting. 



Your Spotify subscription, in the grand scheme of things, won’t break the bank. That’s one of the biggest counter-intuitive [money secrets no one tells you](<money things no one tells you>). 



But to anyone who thinks buying a home is the end-all, be-all of life: DON’T. 

We’re all for you being the owner of your dream home – just PLEASE think twice before you jump into a 30-year mortgage commitment that could potentially suck up all the life (and money) out of you. 

**\
Sometimes, the more financially savvy thing to do is legit rent an awesome place, and continue to save for your future home at your own pace – and have more money in your pocket so you can keep your Spotify account (Netflix, Hulu, you get it).**

# **Money Maker 2 - City Gal**

This money maker lives in the heart of a big city (New York City to be exact), doesn’t own a car or a house yet, and works in a salaried job in the biz world 

> **$57,000 salary** >> wahoo!
>
> **$15,000 taxes** >> ugh, gotta love taxes
>
> **$45,000 expenses** >> ooooh ya, spending money honey 

$57,000 - $15,000 - $45,000 = **negative $3k, uh-o**

\
Ok lets look at her expenses and see what magic can be done

\
Rent*

$2,000

this is a lot – start looking for a roommate or rent out your apt on Airbnb for a month to help cover expenses

\---

Student loans

$300

triple check this is the minimum payment, and that it covers interest – if it’s more than you need to pay, drop it down, for now 

\---

Health Insurance

$300

gotta have insurance

\---

Subway

$100

gotta get to work (but if this was uber/taxi, would cut that out)

\---

Cell phone

$120

gotta have a phone – keep an eye out for a promo!

\---

Food

$500

gotta eat – but if this includes eating out, think about how often you go, how much you spend, and if there are alternatives you can fit into your lifestyle instead

\---

Self-care

$100

you can try to cut out or do every other month, but how else are you going to survey in the big city, mental health is #1 priority 

\---

Shopping

$150

you can try to lower this a tad but even if you do Rent the runway or build a capsule wardrobe, it’ll cost you at aleast this #.... so focus on feeling confident when you walk into work with the most classic pieces that you can mix&match

\---

Misc expenses

$180

This you want to be mindful of – think, laundry detergent, tampons, random household stuff... Before you know it, you just bought 2 books, a picture frame, and scrunchies on Amazon – sh!t adds up fast!

\
Super-saver tip – put misc stuff on a separate credit card so you can really see where $ goes to waste. Don’t try to budget $50 or less, you’ll go over every single time and feel like crap. Instead, pay closer attention to what you’re spending on and stick to a number that’s actually realistic.

\---

Travel

$0

use credit card points to book a trip! 



$3,750 per month
